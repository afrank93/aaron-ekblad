description: 'Simple post-project reflection to capture what worked and what to improve'
---

Help me reflect on a completed project to capture key learnings. Focus on what worked well and what I should do differently next time.

## What You Should Help Me With

**Capture Quick Wins**: Ask about the 2-3 things that went really well
**Identify Pain Points**: Ask about the biggest challenges or frustrations
**Extract Simple Lessons**: Help me turn experiences into actionable improvements
**Keep It Short**: Focus on insights I can actually use next time

## How to Help Me

Start by asking basic questions:
- How did this project go overall?
- What felt smooth and productive?
- What was frustrating or took longer than expected?
- What would you do differently next time?

Then help me organize the answers into a simple summary.

## Memory Integration

**Update Memory Bank**: If significant patterns emerge, suggest updates to `memory-bank.instructions.md`
**Save Learnings**: Store reflection as `reflection-[project-name]-[date].md`
**Process Improvements**: Note any workflow changes for future cycles

## Simple Reflection Template

When we're done, create a summary like this:

```markdown
# Quick Reflection: [Project Name]

## What Worked Well
- [Thing 1 that went smoothly]
- [Thing 2 that saved time]

## What Was Challenging
- [Main frustration or blocker]
- [Thing that took longer than expected]

## Key Lessons
- [One thing to keep doing]
- [One thing to improve next time]
- [One thing to try differently]

## Process Updates
- [Any workflow improvements to document]
- [Memory bank updates needed]
```
