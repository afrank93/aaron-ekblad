# Capture Development Cycle Learnings

Your goal is to extract actionable insights from completed development cycles and document them in structured formats that improve future workflow execution and team knowledge.

## Learning Extraction Framework

You WILL capture insights across these key areas:
- **Process Effectiveness**: Which workflow steps provided value vs. caused friction

- **Quality Outcomes**: How well specifications matched implementation reality
- **Estimation Accuracy**: Time and effort prediction vs. actual requirements
- **Problem-Solving Patterns**: Successful approaches for overcoming challenges

## Learning Documentation Template

Structure captured learnings using this format:

```markdown

## Learning Extraction Guidelines

### Focus on Actionable Insights
You WILL prioritize learnings that:
- Can be immediately applied to improve next cycle effectiveness
- Address specific pain points experienced during development
- Enhance estimation accuracy and planning quality  
- Improve technical decision-making and implementation speed
- Strengthen workflow tools and process effectiveness

### Balance Success and Challenge Analysis
You WILL ensure comprehensive learning by:
- Identifying successful patterns that should be replicated systematically
- Analyzing challenges constructively to extract improvement opportunities  
- Recognizing both process and technical factors affecting outcomes
- Connecting learning insights to specific, implementable changes

### Maintain Practical Focus
You WILL keep learning documentation:
- Focused on insights that improve real development effectiveness
- Specific enough to guide concrete changes in tools and processes
- Realistic about implementation constraints and resource availability
- Connected to measurable improvements in future cycle outcomes

## Quality Validation Requirements

Before finalizing learning documentation, verify:

### Insight Completeness
- [ ] Both process and technical learnings are captured comprehensively
- [ ] Success factors are analyzed as thoroughly as challenge factors  
- [ ] Learning insights connect clearly to specific cycle experiences
- [ ] Improvement recommendations are actionable and specific

### Application Readiness  
- [ ] Workflow improvements can be implemented before next cycle begins
- [ ] Tool and template enhancements are feasible with available resources
- [ ] Success measures provide clear validation of learning application  
- [ ] Knowledge transfer requirements have realistic timelines and ownership

### Future Value  
- [ ] Learnings address real pain points that affect development effectiveness
- [ ] Insights apply broadly to future cycles, not just specific technical contexts
- [ ] Improvement strategies are sustainable and don't create new problems
- [ ] Success metrics can be tracked and validated in subsequent cycles

## Success Criteria

Learning capture is effective when:
- Specific, actionable improvements are identified for future cycles  
- Both successful practices and challenge resolutions are documented clearly
- Workflow tools and processes can be enhanced based on real experience
- Technical knowledge gained is transferable to future development decisions
- Next cycle preparation includes concrete changes based on learning insights
- Team knowledge is preserved and available for future reference

Remember: The goal is to extract practical wisdom from completed cycles that demonstrably improves future development effectiveness. Focus on learnings that can be applied immediately and measured for impact in subsequent work.
