Solo Dev Process (6 Steps)
1) Brainstorm & Organize

- Freely document ideas at any level (purpose, features, components)
- AI structures your brainstorm into organized document without modifications
- Review organized ideas before moving forward

2) Define Scope & Features

- Establish: What problem you're solving, success criteria, key constraints
- Draft features using your template (you + AI suggestions)
- AI critically reviews feature definitions for clarity and completeness with specific improvement steps
- Revise until features are well-defined and approved
- Define prioritization criteria: dependencies, value, learning goals, or risk

3) Specify & Design

- AI drafts detailed specs from approved features
- Include: technical approach, data models, component structure, edge cases
- Review specs for feasibility and completeness
- Revise if needed (spec problems loop back here, feature problems back to step 2)
- Approve final specs

4) Prioritize & Prepare

- Add approved specs to backlog and prioritize using your criteria
- Write tests based on spec requirements before coding (validates understanding, creates safety net)
- Review architecture/design approach one final time

5) Build & Validate

- You lead coding with AI providing feedback and oversight
- Use version control (feature branches, clear commits)
- If blocked >30 min, AI proposes solution with explanation
- Run tests and validate against specs
- Debug and fix issues (code bugs iterate here, spec issues back to step 3)
- Deploy when tests pass

6) Reflect & Improve

- Capture 2-3 key learnings: What worked? What to improve?
- Update process document or notes
- Feed learnings into next cycle
